Setting up Video Analysis Environment on Google Colab:
1. Access Google Colab: Open Google Colab in your web browser.
2. Library Setup: Import and execute all necessary libraries for video processing and analysis. Include dependencies such as OpenCV for frame extraction and TensorFlow for model integration.
3. Upload Videos to Google Drive: Upload your video files to Google Drive for easy access within Google Colab.
4. Folder Creation in Google Drive: Within Google Colab, create two folders in Google Drive:
       video_data: This folder will be used for uploading your video files.
       save_frames: Frames extracted from videos will be saved in this folder.
5. Violence Detection Implementation: Implement a script to process each frame extracted from the videos. Use a pre-trained model or custom algorithms to classify frames as depicting violence or non-violence.
